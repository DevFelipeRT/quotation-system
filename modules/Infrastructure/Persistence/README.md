# Persistence (Database) Module Documentation

---

## Overview

The **Persistence** module is responsible for all data persistence and retrieval operations within the system. Architected strictly under Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, it offers a robust, extensible, and observable framework for relational database operations (via PDO), including credential safety, exception handling, and event-based observability.

**Core objectives:**

* Provide multi-driver SQL support (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite; extensible for others)
* Standardize connection and execution flows through contracts and service layers
* Enable complete observability by raising domain events for all relevant lifecycle steps
* Ensure credential safety and integrity using Value Objects and secure memory handling
* Centralize all error and exception management via explicit domain and infrastructure exceptions

This module is foundational to the reliability, maintainability, and traceability of the systemâ€™s data access layer.

---

## Structure

The module is organized into clearly defined layers and components, in alignment with DDD and Clean Architecture.

### 1. Domain Layer

**a) Contracts (`Domain/Contract/`)**

* `DatabaseConnectionInterface`:
  Declares essential methods for connecting, disconnecting, and validating database sessions.
  Supports transactional demarcation (begin, commit, rollback) and exposes native PDO/driver access when needed.

* `DatabaseExecutionInterface`:
  Defines the contract for executing SQL queries (prepared and raw), as well as transaction controls.

* `DatabaseCredentialsInterface`:
  Specifies interface for credential value objects, including methods for DSN construction and credential access.

**b) Value Objects (`Domain/ValueObject/`)**

* `DatabaseSecret`:
  Immutably encapsulates secrets (passwords) with secure access semantics. Prevents accidental logging/exposure.

* `MySqlCredentials`, `PostgreSqlCredentials`, `SqliteCredentials`:
  Specialized VOs for encapsulating driver-specific connection attributes, all implementing `DatabaseCredentialsInterface`.

**c) Domain Events (`Domain/Event/`)**

* `ConnectionSucceededEvent`
* `ConnectionFailedEvent`
* `RequestExecutedEvent`
* `RequestFailedEvent`

All events provide contextual details (driver, schema, DSN, credentials used, SQL, parameters, errors), supporting full observability and diagnostic capabilities.

**d) Support (`Domain/Support/`)**

* `CredentialsSecurity`:
  Utilities for secure handling of secrets, including masking and safe memory access.
  Useful for audit trails and defensive programming, preventing accidental leakage.

---

### 2. Infrastructure Layer

**a) Services**

* `PdoConnectionService`:
  Implements `DatabaseConnectionInterface`. Orchestrates DSN creation, manages PDO instantiation, and configures driver-specific options.
  Handles exceptions explicitly, raising domain events as side-effects.

* `PdoExecutionService`:
  Implements `DatabaseExecutionInterface`.
  Receives queries and parameters, always executes using prepared statements, and triggers events for success/failure.

* `PersistenceKernel`:
  Facade/orchestrator responsible for integrating all services and providing a unified interface for higher application layers.
  Handles schema-aware connection routing and execution delegation.

**b) Exceptions (`Infrastructure/Exceptions/`)**

* `DatabaseConnectionException`
* `MissingDriverConfigurationException`
* `UnsupportedDriverException`
* `RequestExecutionException`

All exceptions are typed, descriptive, and capture full context for downstream error handling and incident analysis.
Stack traces and contextual data (DSN, SQL, parameters, error code) are preserved.

**c) Support (`Infrastructure/Support/`)**

* `DriverValidator`:
  Validates presence, correctness, and completeness of driver configuration before any connection attempt.
  Guards against misconfiguration, unsupported drivers, or missing attributes, failing fast and observably.

---

## Core Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**

   * Application or test code provides driver configuration (driver, host, port, database, credentials) in a strongly-typed array or config object.
   * Credentials are instantiated as immutable Value Objects, preventing mutation and accidental exposure.
   * `DriverValidator` checks configuration completeness and driver support.

2. **Connection**

   * A call to `PersistenceKernel` requests a connection (optionally passing schema).
   * `PdoConnectionService` selects the correct driver and builds the DSN.
   * Upon connection attempt, the relevant event (`ConnectionSucceededEvent` or `ConnectionFailedEvent`) is emitted.

3. **Execution**

   * Application calls `execute` or `executeRaw` on the kernel.
   * `PdoExecutionService` receives the query and bindings.
   * All executions are performed via prepared statements (PDO).
   * Success or failure raises `RequestExecutedEvent` or `RequestFailedEvent`, both carrying detailed context.

4. **Transactions**

   * Transactional demarcation (`beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollback`) is provided both in the connection interface and kernel facade.

5. **Error Handling**

   * All exceptions in connection or execution are typed and context-rich.
   * Application/service layer may catch specific exceptions for granular logic.

6. **Observability**

   * All domain events are dispatched through the event system.
   * Listeners can be registered to log, audit, or trace any aspect of database activity.

---

## Events Architecture

**Emitted Events**

* `ConnectionSucceededEvent`
* `ConnectionFailedEvent`
* `RequestExecutedEvent`
* `RequestFailedEvent`

Events are fired on both connection lifecycle and each query execution. Each carries:

* Driver and DSN
* Connection parameters (with secret masking)
* Schema (if applicable)
* SQL and all bindings (for executed queries)
* Detailed error message/stack (for failures)
* Timestamp and unique context id (when applicable)

**Event Listener Registration**

Listeners may be registered using the event dispatcher system (integration with `Shared\Event\Contracts\EventDispatcherInterface`).
Events are designed for downstream extensibility: metrics, tracing, logging, security auditing, etc.

Example test listeners and utilities are provided for integration testing, ensuring observability is always testable.

---

## Security Model

* **Credential Encapsulation:**
  All passwords/secrets are held only in `DatabaseSecret` VOs, never as raw strings. Utilities guarantee secrets are not leaked through logs or stack traces.

* **Prepared Statements Everywhere:**
  Every execution is through parameterized/prepared statements, eliminating classic SQL injection vectors.

* **Early and Defensive Validation:**
  Driver and configuration validation is enforced on startup. No connection is ever attempted with an incomplete or unsupported configuration.

* **Exception Contextualization:**
  Sensitive data is masked in exceptions; only non-sensitive context is exposed downstream, supporting secure observability.

* **Observability Without Exposure:**
  Emitted events pass only safe details, and masking utilities are provided to ensure compliance with audit and privacy requirements.

---

## Extending the Module

### 1. Adding a New Driver

* Implement a new Value Object for driver credentials, extending `DatabaseCredentialsInterface`.
* Extend `PdoConnectionService` to support DSN logic for the new driver.
* Register the driver and its options in the configuration array/object.
* Implement corresponding exception handling and (if necessary) event extensions.

### 2. Custom Execution Patterns

* Extend `PdoExecutionService` or implement your own `DatabaseExecutionInterface`.
* Register new events for custom execution phases (e.g., long-running query timeout, connection pool events).

### 3. Advanced Observability

* Implement listeners that log to external APMs, metrics or tracing systems.
* Add support for distributed tracing context propagation if required.

### 4. Credential Management

* Integrate with secret managers or rotate secrets dynamically via adapters.
* Extend `CredentialsSecurity` for external source integration or rotation events.

### 5. Schema and Multi-Tenant Support

* Expand Value Objects and kernel logic to handle dynamic schema routing.
* Support read/write split, replica selection, or per-tenant credentials.

## Usage Examples

### Connecting and Executing a Query

```php
use Persistence\Infrastructure\PersistenceKernel;

$kernel = new PersistenceKernel($config);
$connection = $kernel->getConnection(); // Returns DatabaseConnectionInterface

$result = $kernel->execute(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email',
    [':email' => 'foo@bar.com']
);
// $result is array|object depending on driver/fetch style
```

### Listening to Events

```php
use Persistence\Domain\Event\RequestExecutedEvent;

class LogQueryListener
{
    public function __invoke(RequestExecutedEvent $event)
    {
        // Log or process $event->getSql(), $event->getBindings(), etc.
    }
}

// Register with your event dispatcher system
```

### Transaction Management

```php
$connection->beginTransaction();
try {
    $kernel->execute('UPDATE ...');
    $connection->commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    $connection->rollback();
    // Handle error
}
```
