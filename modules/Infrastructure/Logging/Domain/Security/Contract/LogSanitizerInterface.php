/**
 * Contract for domain-level input sanitizers responsible for masking or redacting sensitive
 * information from log contexts, SQL parameter bindings, or any structure to be persisted or transmitted.
 *
 * Architectural Notes:
 * - This contract MUST be implemented in the Domain layer and referenced by all Value Objects (VOs)
 *   that represent loggable data. Its use in VOs is mandatory to enforce security at the domain level.
 * - All other layers (Application, Infrastructure, Presentation, etc.) MAY consume or compose with
 *   this contract to further enforce or reuse the domainâ€™s masking policies, but SHOULD NOT
 *   implement their own independent logic for sensitive data detection or masking.
 * - The implementation is responsible for consistently masking, redacting, or removing
 *   passwords, secrets, tokens, personal data, or any other sensitive information according to
 *   organizational and regulatory requirements.
 *
 * Security Warning:
 * - Logging of sensitive information is a common source of security breaches and regulatory violations.
 *   The implementation of this contract MUST be audited and kept up to date with business and
 *   compliance requirements.
